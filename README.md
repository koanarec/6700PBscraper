# 6700PBscraper
This shows how many 6700xt graphics cards that PB tech have in stock. It also graphs this. 


You need to keep the text file and the CSV file. If you want to delete the current data delete it from the txt file. Not the CSV file. 
It needs an empty CSV file to work so don't get rid of it.

You can probably make this work for any graphics card just by swapping out the links. You will need more links as well because it is not an exhaustive list of
the available OEM models. That is because when there is zero in stock and zero expected you cannot get the right link. Click the existing links to see what 
links you need to add.
